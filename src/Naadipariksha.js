                <p>Nadi Pariksha (also spelled as Naadi Pareeksha) is a traditional method of diagnosing patients through the distinct wave frequencies of their pulses. It is simple but still quite unexplainable to the eyes of non-medical practitioners, as the skilled doctors only use their index finger, sensing vata dosha; middle finger, sensing pitta dosha; and ring finger, sensing kapha dosha; altogether to identify whatever disease is in the patient’s system, without the help of a stethoscope or other modern medical equipment. Nadi Pariksha is a pulse reading technique developed by Ayurveda thousands of years ago and this time-tested method worked before and is still reliable up to this day. It can detect the patient’s physical, mental, and emotional imbalances, including mild to chronic diseases with just a gentle touch of the doctors’ hands.</p>
                <p>Following the series of extensive questions done during Ayurvedic consultation with their initial prognosis, the doctors will connect their findings with the beating patterns of your pulse, which will lead them to the root causes of your diseases. The waves transmitted by the pulse are defined by the imbalance of your doshas, blood vessels’ contraction and relaxation, and the blood movement through the arteries, like a distress signal calling for the doctor’s help.</p>
            
                <h5><b>Demystifying your doshas</b></h5>
                <p>Every cell in the body is constituted by three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha, and each plays a unique but equally important role from one another. Vata controls the movements and motion throughout the body, Pitta oversees digestion and metabolism, and Kapha is in-charge of the body’s physical and the fluid balance. However, as unique as fingerprints, no two mixes of doshas are the same. In other words, you are your own mix of doshas, which can undergo unpredictable changes influenced by the environment, emotions, and the like, that even the smallest tweak can equate to various diseases.</p>

                  <li>The doctor will then touch the skin covering the radial artery with three fingers (index, middle, ring fingers), while the index finger is placed just below the root of the patient’s thumb. </li>
                  <li>Subtle or not, the vibrations are read at seven different levels.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Naadi Pareeksha treatment is best done in the morning on an empty stomach, so that the process of breaking down food would not interfere with the exam. </p>



                <h5><b>Nadi Tarangini</b></h5>
              <p>When an ancient healing system meets modern technology, Nadi Tarangini is the best example there is. It is a medicinal equipment that advances the capabilities of the traditional Nadi Pariksha diagnosis by auscultating the tiniest changes in the rhythm of the patient’s heartbeat and the blend of their Vatta, Pitta, and Kapha Doshas.
Nadi Tarangini can also generate medical reports about the patient’s pulse readings in a form of a graph, included in a summary report that serves as an overview of the patient’s health, and a comprehensive 10-page report including advanced Ayurveda parameters which will be interpreted by the Ayurvedic doctor. The data also enables the doctor to predict possible ailments the patient may contract in the future.
This technological breakthrough has shown promising results in studies related to diabetes, cardiology, fertility, arthritis, mental disorder, and hypertension.</p>

                <h5><b>Benefits</b></h5>
                <p>Naadi Pareeksha can help you foresee the potential diseases and help you prevent them from destroying the balance of your doshas. Some of the chronic diseases that Nadi Pariksha can detect are infertility, paralysis, mental disorders, diabetes, and the like. After the procedure, the doctor will prescribe herbal medicines, Ayurvedic treatments, and lifestyle changes congruent to the patient’s condition.</p>

              <div id="demoa" class="collapse">
                  Nadi Pariksha is Ayurveda’s version of pulse diagnosis which is best done during the morning. With the use of your index, middle, and ring fingers, you can detect your body's doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha). Vata has a thin, fast, and irregular rhythm. Pitta’s rhythm has more volume and is stronger. Kapha has a regular and slower rhythm.

                  Ayurvedic doctors have the experience of interpreting one’s pulse and how it is tied up to the patient’s present symptoms. By connecting the two (pulse readings and symptoms), the doctors can now give an accurate diagnosis of a patient’s disease.
