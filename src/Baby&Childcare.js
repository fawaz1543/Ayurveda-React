                  <p>Babies are frail creatures. Their immune system is weak and bones are brittle, which would force any parent to be at their cleanest and most gentle state in order to avoid any injuries or serious health concerns. The same thing goes with children. Although taking care of them won’t be as protective as parents should be with babies, every psychological, physiological, and health facet in children is still immature. </p>
                  <p>Babies will develop rashes or acne in the face or body due to the mother’s hormones running through their system. It is normal to all newborns. However, if it’s not resolved in three to six weeks, it might be an allergy, eczema, psoriasis, or other skin conditions. Aside from the fontanelle, a baby’s scalp is delicate too as it scratches easily. Moreover, cradle caps or the scaly patches on the scalp manifest in three-month-old babies. </p>
                  <p>Children, on the other hand, unconsciously infect or expose themselves to diseases. Playing outside the house, interacting with other children who may have diseases too. Daycare centers and schools are two of the establishments where children unknowingly pass around viruses and diseases. Furthermore, children have not yet developed immunologic defenses to repel diseases. </p>
