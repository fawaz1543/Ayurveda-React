                <p>Excessive weight gain is one of the most prominent health problems out there.
                     It affects both the physical and mental health of people who cannot seem 
                     to find a solution to stop the accumulation of fats in their bodies.
                      Obesity is caused by a lot of factors: genetics, junk foods, food addiction, 
                      insulin, medications, leptin resistance, and sugar. </p>

                <p>
                Children of obese parents are more susceptible to excessive weight gain than those of lean 
                parents. Although obesity is not completely predetermined by heredity, genes still play a 
                role in a person’s weight gain. Another reason is the production of processed foods which
                 are engineered to taste good and last longer than natural ones. They are addictive, unhealthy,
                  and convenient for consumers to buy. This brings us to the unrestrained food cravings which
                   is considered as an addiction and is comparable to that of alcoholism. Sugary foods and junk
                    foods stimulate the brain to cause this addiction. High insulin levels also promote obesity
                     as this hormone stores the energy in the fat cells, fructose in added sugar causes insulin 
                     resistance which contributes to obesity.  There are also certain medications that have weight
                      gain as their side effects. Medicines for diabetes, depression, psychotics, and the like are
                       some examples of these medications. Leptin is a hormone that tells the brain to reduce the 
                       body’s appetite. However, people with obesity have high levels of this hormone that do not work 
                       properly.
