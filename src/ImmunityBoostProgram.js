                <p>The pandemic warrants immunity boosting for all ages as the cure for COVID-19 is still far from unravelling itself before our eyes. Dozens of scientists, doctors, and other medical practitioners have already affirmed that the vaccine’s sole proxy is a fortified immune system. Building a strong immunity, however, is not limited to medicines. Vitamin-packed fruits, vegetables, and herbs have been sitting inside supermarkets, waiting for people to grab bundles of them. Ayurveda has crates of fruits, vegetables, and herbs that will certainly boost the immune system and fight off viruses and diseases.

                <p>It is important to note that while we can strengthen our immune system, we can also weaken it by our unhealthy habits and lifestyles. Here are some of the factors that causes the deterioration of the body’s immune system:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>High stress </li>
                  <li>Dehydration</li>
                  <li>Irregular sleep</li>
                  <li>Unhealthy diet</li>
                  <li>Unmoderated alcohol intake</li>
                  <li>Obesity </li>

           <ul>
            <li>Giloy - It is filled with health benefits. It has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, anti-cancer, and immunomodulatory properties and can reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
            <li>Tulsi - It can promote healthy digestion and has anti-viral properties.</li>
            <li>Chirata Powder - It has anti-inflammatory, anti-asthmatic and expectorant properties</li>
            <li> Mulethiy - It provides relief for sore throat and can strengthen immunity</li>
           </ul>


            <p>Take a half spoon of each, boil them in a pot with a glass of water. Let the concoction cool and drink.</p>

            <p>Other immunity boosters that can be bought on the supermarket include ginger, turmeric, and pippali that have anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and antioxidant properties, and can increase the body’s immunomodulation. Fruits such as pomegranate, apples, peaches, pears, plums, mangoes, and pineapples are good sources of immunity strength. Furthermore, going green with cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, mustard greens, will give you antioxidants, flavonoids, and immunity boost as well. Eating barley and other whole grains like quinoa and amaranth will cleanse the digestive system and provide nutrients too.
