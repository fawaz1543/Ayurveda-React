                <p>Ayurveda consultation was already helping thousands of people detect their
                   diseases even before the emergence of technological advancements in the field 
                   of medicine, and it has not stopped ever since. This is through ashtavidha pariksha
                   or eight-fold examination (ashta means “eight,” vidha, means “fold,” and pariksha
                    means “exam”). The Ayurvedic doctor will get to know the patient and understand
                    their habits, their medical history including the diseases they had in the past
                     with the help of this exam. Their answers to the doctor’s questions will be 
                    connected with the results yielded by ashtavidha pariksha and will help acknowledge 
                    why their doshas are imbalanced and what solutions would be best to realign them.</p>

                <p>The Ayurvedic approach to one’s health is revolutionized by Adam & Eve Ayurveda here
                   in Abu Dhabi by combining the traditional practices of Ayurveda and modern methods of
                    technology. Apart from the Eight-fold Examination, we dive deep into the patient’s
                     history to gather more information about the patient’s health and for more accurate 
                     diagnosis. Latest imaging technologies are used if needed. </p>

              <div className="Treatment-Content-two">
                    <h5><b>Ashtavidha Pariksha (Eight-fold Examination)</b></h5>


                    <ul>
                      <li>Our Ayurvedic doctors will use the Eight-fold Examination to scrutinize the patient’s pulse, tongue, voice, skin, eyes, general appearance, urine, and stool.</li>
                      <li>Pulse diagnosis – also called Nadi Pariksha, the pulse will be examined through its beating patterns, frequencies, and the like in seven different levels</li>
                      <li>Tongue diagnosis – the color, texture, and shape of the tongue will be examined to get information about the gall bladder, pancreas, or bacterial infection.</li>
                      <li>Voice diagnosis – whether it is cracked, hoarse, or heavy, the voice speaks volumes about the balance of your doshas</li>
                      <li>Skin diagnosis – any nutritional deficiency can be seen through the skin by its smoothness, dryness, temperature, etc. </li>
                      <li>Eyes diagnosis – the eyes can tell the doctor if the patient’s body has issues about the brain, iron absorption, pancreas, and liver</li>
                      <li>General appearance diagnosis - the patient’s body shape, hair color and texture, face, and aura can tell the doctor about the predominance of doshas in your body</li>
                      <li>Urine diagnosis – its color, frequency, or if there’s any discomfort while urinating can indicate the patient’s health condition </li>
                      <li>Stool diagnosis – this examination can tell a lot about the patient’s digestive health</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h5><b>Patient History is Vital</b></h5>
                    In the middle and after the assessment, the doctor will ask the patient various questions about their medical history,
                    relationships, etc. to demystify their dosha imbalances and to unearth the root causes of each of their ailments. In this
                    session the doctor will have a discussion with the patient and their:
                    
                    <ul>
                      <li>Past and present lifestyle, eating habits, and daily routines</li>
                      <li>Pregnancy and menstrual cycles (for women)</li>
                      <li>Family medical history </li>
                      <li>Past experiences and encounters to diagnose their character</li>
                      <li>Past and current relationships </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5><b>Findings</b></h5>   
                      As soon as we have the essential details that we need, we will start creating a tailor-made program for
                      the patient depending on the results of the two thorough assessments. The doctor will discuss the patient’s:
