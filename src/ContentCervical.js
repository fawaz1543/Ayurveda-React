                <br/>
                <p>Cervical spondylosis, another term for neck arthritis or cervical osteoarthritis is
                   a very common degenerative condition caused by the abrasion or the wear and tear of
                    bones and cartilages affecting the spinal disks in the neck. 
                  Mild to severe neck pains due to arthritis are caused by the deterioration of the thick,
                   cushion-like disc between every bone of your spine which absorbs various shock intensities
                    from twisting, lifting, or other activities. This occurs when the gel-like substance inside 
                    these discs start to dry out, causing your spinal vertebrae to rub against each other more
                     often than it is normally intended. It usually starts at the age of 30 and gets worse as 
                     you grow older. In fact, 90 percent of people aged 60 and above have cervical spondylosis,
                      giving them neck pains and stiffness.</p>

                <h5><b>Symptoms of Cervical Spondylosis</b></h5>
                In most cases, cervical spondylosis poses no symptoms. But if one or more symptoms occur,
                 it typically gives you neck pains and stiffness. Here are the other symptoms you can look for: 
                <ul>
                  <li>You can’t fully rotate, bend, or turn the neck</li>
                  <li>Headaches originating from the neck</li>
                  <li>You can feel or hear a grinding sensation while you turn your neck</li>
                  <li>Shoulder or arms pain</li>
                  <li>Lack of coordination and difficulty walking</li>
                  <li>Tingling, numbness and weakness in your arms, hands, legs or feet</li>
                  <li>Loss of bladder or bowel control</li>
                </ul>

                <h5><b>Risk factors</b></h5>             
                Since this is an age-related condition, everyone is not safe from having 
                arthritis of the neck. Specially those who had past neck injuries, family 
                members who have the condition which can be passed down through genes, and
                people who smoke are more at risk of cervical spondylosis. 

                <br/><br/>
                <h5><b>Ayurvedic Treatment for Cervical Spondylosis</b></h5> 
                As spine-chilling as the term sounds, non-operative neck pain treatments are
                predominantly effective and can actually cure it. You can use hot or cold compress
                to relieve sore muscles or an assistance of a therapist who will guide you for proper
                stretching techniques to strengthen neck muscles. Other cervical spondylosis treatments include
                Ayurvedic therapies like Abhyangam, Podikzhi, Pizhichil, and Nasyam that use natural oils and 
                herbs that can save someone’s neck.
