                  <p>Pregnancy is one of the major health challenges that both mother and father will face 
                      before having a family. The mother, however, will carry more weight in this endeavour

                       womb as well. Several health concerns will inevitably come in her way due
                        to hormonal changes which the mother should watch out for. </p>

                  <h5><b>How can Ayurveda take care of pregnant women?</b></h5>
                  <p>Fats and oils may sound unhealthy but consuming these two
                       is important for both the mother and her baby. These will 
                       allow the mother to gain weight so the baby can have a 
                       steady supply of nutrients and, simultaneously, develop
                        the baby’s brain. Fortunately, healthy fats and oils
                         exist, i.e. olive oil, coconut oil, walnuts, cashews,
                          organic whole milk, etc. Moreover, daily intake of
                           one teaspoon each of warm milk and grass-fed oil will
                            boost the baby’s immunity. To improve digestion and
                             induce deeper sleep, dissolve half teaspoon of 
                             turmeric powder and half teaspoon of cardamom 
                             powder in one cup of hot milk with honey. </p> 

                <p>Incorporate a sattvic diet. The word “sattvic” means fresh
                     in Ayurveda, which means no leftovers or processed foods
                      should enter the pregnant woman’s body. Only freshly 
                      cooked foods are allowed for an easier digestion.
                       Examples of these are: whole grains, organic dairy,
                        fruits, and vegetables that will develop prana 
                        (cosmic life force) and ojas (vitality) for the
                         mother and child. Maintaining a sattvic diet during 
                         pregnancy gives clarity in the mother’s mind. </p>

                 
                 <p> Abhyangam is an Ayurvedic treatment that massages the body
                      with herbal oils. This type of body massage will drive
                       stress away and replace it with a much needed relaxation. 
                       With the belief that the baby feels what her mother feels,
                        Abhyangam is a perfect way to send motherly affection to
                         her unborn child. </p>

          
             <h5><b>Ayurvedic Postnatal Treatments</b></h5>

                <p>Postnatal Abyangham is also effective even after giving birth.
                     It can reinvigorate the nerves, remove stress, fatigue, and
                      relieve muscle pains in the core and in the upper extremities
                       like shoulders, back, and arms. Abyangham also increases 
                       circulation and cures insomnia.</p>

               <p>For lactation, it is highly advised to go vegetarian and avoid 
                   eating foods with preservatives and spicy because these foods
                    may decrease the secretion. Do not expose the body to pollution
                     because the dirt might be transferred to the baby. Ghee and
                      oils should be taken in adequate amounts to improve digestion, 
                      facilitate the evacuation of bowels, nourish the traumatized 
                      tissues, and subdue the vitiated Vata Dosha, which gets
                       aggravated during the process of childbirth. After four 
                       months of delivery, the infant must be fed with well-cooked 
                       rice. Medications should be monitored as well because drugs
                        may have serious side-effects to the baby. </p>
